# MacroScope
A full-stack project meant to track global events/relevant macro trends.

04.21.2025
## Set-up
Use the following command to create a virtual env called macroVenv, or name it what you'd like: python3 -m venv macroVenv
For good practice, I set up my venv in a separate folder outside called virtual-envs

Replace line 4 in the run.sh file with your path and venv name
Run the following line once: chmod +x run.sh
Now to run the program, simply enter ./run.sh in your terminal!

This will download all packages from requirements.txt and run the recession_tool.py script automatically.
